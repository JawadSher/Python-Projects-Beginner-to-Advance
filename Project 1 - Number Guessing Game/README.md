## Number Guessing Game Explanation

This Python script implements a simple number guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number within a certain number of rounds.

### How it Works

- The script starts by importing necessary modules: `random` for generating random numbers and `time` for implementing a countdown.
- A random number between 0 and 99 is generated using `random.randint(0, 99)`.
- The user is prompted to input the number of rounds they want to play.
- If the input number of rounds is 0, the script prompts the user to enter a valid number of rounds.
- Otherwise, a countdown of 3 seconds is initiated using `time.sleep(1)` and displayed on the console.
- After the countdown, the game begins with the specified number of rounds.
- In each round, the user is prompted to guess the number.
- Feedback is provided to the user based on their guess:
  - If the guess is higher than the random number, the script informs the user that their input is greater.
  - If the guess is lower than the random number, the script informs the user that their input is less.
  - If the guess is equal to the random number, the script congratulates the user and ends the game.
- The number of rounds remaining is decremented after each guess, and the user is informed about it.
- The game continues until either the user guesses the correct number or runs out of rounds.

### How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
2. Run the script using Python 3.x.
3. Enter the desired number of rounds when prompted.
4. Follow the instructions to guess the random number within the specified rounds.

Enjoy playing the number guessing game!
