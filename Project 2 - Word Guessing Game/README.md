# Word Guessing Game

This is a simple word guessing game implemented in Python. The objective is to guess a randomly chosen word by guessing one letter at a time.

## How to Play

1. The program will greet you and ask for your name.
2. A random word will be chosen from a predefined list.
3. You have a limited number of rounds to guess the word. The number of rounds is equal to the length of the word plus one.
4. In each round, you will guess a letter.
5. If the guessed letter is in the word, it will be revealed in its correct position(s).
6. If the guessed letter is not in the word, the number of remaining rounds will decrease.
7. The game continues until you either guess the word correctly or run out of rounds.
